                Sculpting Essence into volant black glass, the sorcerer
                unleashes a cascade of obsidian butterflies. She rolls
                (Perception + Occult) as an undodgeable decisive attack
                applied in a line against enemies out to medium range.
                This line is wide enough to strike all opponents within
                the width of a single range band and reaches high enough
                to strike aerial enemies who are at short range to the
                ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be
                targeted by directing the butterflies to fly along an upward
                path, rather than a horizontal one). Battle groups are
                especially vulnerable to being cut down by this spell, taking
                a -2 penalty to Defense against it.
                The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer’s (Essence
                + extra successes), or (Essence + Occult + extra successes)
                against a battle group. It does not reset the sorcerer to base
                Initiative. Scenery made of wood, glass, or other fragile
                materials is generally destroyed. After this spell has been
                cast, the obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter,
                creating terrain that may be hazardous for barefooted
                characters to traverse—treat as an environmental hazard
                inflicting two dice of lethal damage, difficulty 2 to resist
                with a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll, and if the character is
                barefoot, difficult terrain as well. Any character wearing
                armored boots can generally ignore the debris.
                A sorcerer who knows Death of Obsidian Butterflies as
                her control spell gains (Essence) bonus dice to the spell’s
                attack roll. When her emotions run hot, butterfly silhouettes
                rise from her shadow. When she is angry, her fingernails
                turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth
                or paper, rend wood or flesh and other similar stunts.

                        The sorcerer shapes flames of diamond and ruby into the
                        form of a majestic bird of prey, evoking the elemental
                        majesty of the garda birds. The player rolls (Perception +
                        Occult) as a decisive attack against an enemy at up to long
                        range, then sends the raptor streaking forth to consume
                        her foe in deadly flames. The brilliant raptor embodies
                        the sorcerer’s will, with a base lethal damage equal to (her
                        Initiative + current temporary Willpower), and resets her
                        to base Initiative on a successful attack. As long as the
                        raptor deals 3+ levels of damage to its target, it ignites a
                        bonfire (p. 230) that engulfs him and all terrain within
                        short range of him, and burns until the end of the scene.
                        A sorcerer who knows Flight of the Brilliant Raptor as
                        her control spell may use it to attack a target one range
                        band beyond long range by paying an extra 5sm when
                        casting the spell.

                        corpses within 100 yards. She can animate up to as many

                        Refl ections look alive but are not alive, and this
                        property gives the surfaces that create them an affi nity
                        with the Underworld. Caressing a refl ective surface as
                        he casts this spell, the necromancer opens a quicksilver
                        doorway between Creation and the analogous point in
                        the Underworld—or vice versa. Travel between the two is
                        instantaneous, and the passage remains open for the caster’s
                        next three actions. Things can come through the other way,
                        too. Once the connection fades, the road closes viciously.

                        Target: One skeleton
                        The necromancer utters a single syllable of deathly
                        command, and a symbol representing the spell ripples
                        toward its target and brands itself in the center of the
                        skeleton’s ribcage. The caster now commands that
                        skeleton… not good if a person lives around it.
                        The skeleton moves as the caster wills, from dancing
                        a jig to murdering a child, for a number of hours equal
                        to the caster’s (Charisma + Occult). The skeleton acts
                        with either its normal dice pools or those of its normal,
                        fl eshly owner. Living targets suffer an internal penalty
                        on these actions equal to their Essence. A living target
                        may resist, using muscles to struggle against the deathly
                        force that animates his bones. Each action in which he
                        does so, he suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage.
                        Doing so also consumes much more of the spell’s energy,
                        reducing the duration by one hour. When the remaining
                        duration reaches zero hours, the spell ends.
                        Skeletons that kill their contravening hosts claw
                        their way free of the body and become permanent walking
                        dead under the caster’s control. Similarly, casting
                        this spell on an existing skeleton raises it as a permanent
                        zombie. Targeting a skeleton that is already an active
                        walking dead rips its control from its current master.

                        Target: Caster
                        Gesturing at the ground around her, the necromancer
                        makes it glow a faint ivory. One moment later,
                        sharp knives of shattered bone and long, pink-and-red
                        ribbons of fl esh rupture the earth, rising to spin around
                        the caster in a column one yard in radius. They obscure
                        him and move with him, picking up the fl esh and bone
                        of the dead near him and shredding them to absorb
                        them into the charnel whirlwind.
                        This spell adds a -1 external penalty to all closecombat
                        attacks made against the caster and a -3 external
                        penalty to all ranged attacks into or out of the maelstrom.
                        Additionally, anyone caught in the death-storm suffers
                        three dice of lethal damage each action she is exposed
                        to it. Anyone the winds kill gets torn apart and added to
                        the storm. Each body added to the storm thus increases
                        the storm’s radius by one yard. Every two bodies added
                        to the winds increase both external penalties and the
                        dice of damage by one. A maximum of (caster’s Essence
                        x 2) bodies can be added to the storm before it stabilizes
                        and grows no larger

                        Laying his palm on the ground at the spell’s climax,
                        the caster scorches the earth with a black brand in the
                        shape of his hand. Immediately afterward, hundreds of
                        skeletal hands burst upward through the earth, stone
                        or fl ooring to grab anyone present (except the caster),
                        holding them with the strength of the dead.
                        Everyone within 50 yards of the palm-shaped brand
                        suffers a -1 internal penalty to all Dexterity-based actions
                        as they are forced to dance away from the clutching hands.
                        People also suffer a two-yard penalty to movement. Each
                        tick on which someone takes a Move or Dash action, that
                        person suffers a clinch attack from the hands, made with
                        an attack pool of (caster’s Essence + 5). Anyone who falls
                        or is knocked down is automatically grabbed, then the
                        clinch proceeds normally. The hands use the same pool
                        to maintain clinches, and they attempt only to restrain
                        their victims without doing damage. They are easy to destroy—they
                        never defend and they have only one health
                        level—but they are replaced within moments.
                        The hands can capture immaterial beings as easily
                        as any other target, and ghosts caught by the hands
                        become visible. The hands release their grip and vanish

                        Abyssal Exalted count the area as “trappings of the
                        dead.” The region returns to normal overnight after
                        one week, unless the necromancer casts the spell in
                        the Wyld. There, the Underworld’s Essence deadens
                        the region, reducing the Wyld’s strength by one and
                        remaining deathly until the Wyld reinfects it.
                        Demesnes are not valid targets for this spell. The aspected
                        Essence already fl owing through the environment
                        is too strong for Mother Darkness to overwhelm.

                        Dragging from herself the worst of her inner darkness,
                        the necromancer vomits a sticky, black ooze, which
                        fl ows from her to attack an indicated visible enemy
                        within 100 yards. The shadow has Physical Attribute
                        and Martial Arts scores equal to the caster’s Essence,
                        health levels equal to her (Stamina + Essence) and can
                        move at a dash. The viscous thing can be hurt only by
                        magical attacks (against which it has no soak) or fi re.
                        The merest brush with an open fl ame will burn it up in
                        seconds, leaving a tacky, noisome residue on everything

                        it touched. A character clinched by the shadow while
                        it burns takes six levels of lethal damage.
                        The ooze always seeks to immobilize a foe and creep
                        down his throat. It only makes grapple attacks, electing
                        to do damage when in control of the clinch. If its
                        target fl ees, the shadow pursues unerringly, no matter
                        where he goes. Once it kills its target, the shadow falls
                        quiescent within him, leaving no trace but the residue
                        on his body and utter, unrefl ecting blackness in his

                        Prerequisite Charms: Graceful Reed Dancing
                        The Exalt’s skill is such that she can condense an entire
                        emotional range into a single dance that embodies its very
                        meaning. The Solar must dance for at least two minutes
                        in order to use this Charm, rolling (Charisma + Performance)
                        with (Essence) automatic successes against the
                        group’s Resolve. If successful, the group is struck with an
                        emotion conveyed by the dance, each member becoming
                        explicitly aware of one Tie he has which inspires that
                        emotion in him. For instance, if the Solar does a dance that
                        inspires fear, characters recall that which makes them most
                        afraid. If she does a dance which inspires joy, they recall
                        that which brings them the most happiness. If characters
                        do not possess such an Intimacy, the Storyteller may assign
                        one. Affected characters will feel inclined to discuss or act
                        upon their feelings until they are affected by emotional
                        influence that inspires a different mood. Characters who
                        reveal an Intimacy in this fashion lower their Guile to 0
                        for the purposes of detecting and confirming that specific
                        Intimacy. Note that the Solar is not necessarily going to be
                        the beneficiary of the character’s sudden openness, as she
                        might not be directly involved in the conversation. For all
                        her dancing, the Solar is never seen as the deliberate source
                        of the target’s thoughts. Not even All-Encompassing Sorcerous
                        Sight can reveal the power of this Charm.

                        follow its customs, behaving appropriately for the

                        spirits, but moreover, she can see the workings
                        of spirit energies around her. If a character is using a
                        shaping action or Evocation, the Solar may make an Intelligence
